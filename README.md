# ðŸŒº Flower PredictionðŸŒ»

This project builds a machine learning model to predict flower species based on features like petal length, petal width, sepal length, and sepal width. It covers data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation, aiming to predict flower types based on their physical attributes. The project emphasizes the importance of clean data, feature selection, and model evaluation to improve prediction accuracy.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: This step involves cleaning and preparing the dataset to ensure it is free from errors, missing values, or inconsistencies, making it suitable for accurate model training.
- **Model Training**: A machine learning model is developed using the prepared dataset, learning patterns and relationships to classify different flower species effectively.
- **Performance Evaluation**: The trained model's performance is assessed using metrics such as accuracy, helping to ensure its reliability and effectiveness in predicting flower species.

## How It Works

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Prepares the dataset by handling missing values, normalizing data, and splitting it into training and testing sets.
2. **Model Training**: Uses a machine learning algorithm (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Tree) to classify flower species.
3. **Evaluation**: Compares predicted values against actual values to calculate accuracy and other performance metrics.
